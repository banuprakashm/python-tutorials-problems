# Queue

A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the first person who gets the ticket. Queue follows the **First In First Out(FIFO)** rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first too.
